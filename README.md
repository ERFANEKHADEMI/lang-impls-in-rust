# Language implementations Written in Rust
This is a (probably incomplete) list of 130 languages implemented in Rust. It is intended as a source of inspiration and as a directory of potentially interesting projects in this vein.

Inspired by: https://github.com/alilleybrinker/langs-in-rust.

## What Can Be Included?
- Is it a language?
- Is it written in Rust?
Then it can be included in this list!

## How to add my langauge?
- Add information about your project to `list.json` file.
- Run `python generate_readme.py` to generate new README.md.
- Make a pull request and just wait until I add submit it.
